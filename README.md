## About
EdiHeadyTrack is a Python package for measuring head kinematics using markerless head pose detection.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.9.0
	
## Setup
<!-- To run this project, enter

```
$ cd ../pytrote3d
$ python3 trote_3d.py
```

The file that is run and the materials which are used are currently set in trote_3d.py by the following lines

```
# Input file and materials file
filename = 'Tinput.tro'
material = 'materials.json'
``` -->
## To do
- [ ] Write unit tests.
- [ ] Check coverage status
- [ ] Upload to PyPI
- [ ] Update READMe

## Getting Involved
For any suggestions, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/ThomasAston/EdiHeadyTrack/issues).
